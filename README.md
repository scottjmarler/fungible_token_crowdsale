# fungible_token_crowdsale
Creation and deployment of a token and crowdsale contract to raise wei



Created a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

## Usage



* Instructions


    * Created the KaseiCoin token contract.

    * Created the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.

    * Created the KaseiCoin deployer contract.

    * By deploying to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache, I was able to perform a real-world, pre-production test of the crowdsale.
